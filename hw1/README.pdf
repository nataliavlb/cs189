HW11.PY has the code that follows the instructions for 3-6. I have all the function calls for the shuffling, partitioning,
accuracy function, training and tuning to find correct C. In order to run this, just do python hw1.py

save_csv.py includes my code for the final training model that I chose to submit to Kaggle and I used the function given to us to be 
able to export my predictions as a .csv file. In order to run this run save_csv.py 

They both take some time to run (a couple minutes), but will run correctly if you run these commands in their respective directories
